    name: 'GÃ¶del\'s Incompleteness Theorems',
    statement: 'The first incompleteness theorem states that in any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot prove its own consistency.',

    id: 'ftc',
    name: 'Fundamental Theorem of Calculus',
    statement: 'The fundamental theorem of calculus relates the concept of differentiating a function with the concept of integrating a function. The first part states that the definite integration of a function is related to its antiderivative, and can be reversed by differentiation. The second part states that the definite integral of a function can be computed by using any one of its infinitely many antiderivatives.',
