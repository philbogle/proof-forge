The first part states that the definite integration of a function is related to its antiderivative, and can be reversed by differentiation. The second part states that the definite integral of a function can be computed by using any one of its infinitely many antiderivatives.',

The second incompleatness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot prove its own consistency.",
