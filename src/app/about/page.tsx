              Proof Forge is an interactive application designed to make complex mathematical proofs more accessible and understandable. It empowers users to explore proofs at various levels of formalityâ€”from plain English explanations to rigorous mathematical notation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to demystify mathematics by providing tools that aid comprehension. Key features include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Multiple Formality Levels:</strong> Switch between different styles of a proof to build intuition and connect concepts to formal notation.</li>
              <li><strong>Interactive AI Assistant:</strong> Ask questions in natural language to get clarifications on any part of a proof, right when you need it.</li>
              <li><strong>AI-Powered Editing:</strong> For administrators, Proof Forge offers the ability to edit and refine proofs using simple, conversational requests.</li>
              <li><strong>Content Management:</strong> A dedicated admin dashboard allows for easy management of theorems, including adding, approving, and organizing content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This application is built with Next.js, Firebase, and Google's Genkit, showcasing a modern approach to building intelligent and responsive web applications.
