# **App Name**: Proof Explorer

## Core Features:

- Proof Selection: Allow the user to select a pre-defined theorem or enter a theorem name for exploration.
- Formalization Tool: Use an LLM to reason whether certain information will improve the clarity of the output for the specific user
- Level Adjustment: Provide buttons to increase or decrease the level of mathematical formality in the proof presentation.  There should be 4 levels.
- Interactive MathJax: Render mathematical proofs using MathJax for clear and precise notation.
- Natural Language Questioning: Let the user ask freeform natural language questions about the presented theorem and show an LLM generated response. If the user asks about a specific line of reasoning or line of proof, attempt to clarify.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 220, 50%, 60% (RGB Hex: #4D79B3) - A calming, intellectual blue, associated with knowledge and precision.
- Background color: HSL 220, 20%, 95% (RGB Hex: #F0F2F5) - A very light tint of blue that provides a soft, unobtrusive backdrop for mathematical content.
- Accent color: HSL 190, 60%, 50% (RGB Hex: #26A69A) - A contrasting teal, which is close to blue, yet visually distinct, for interactive elements and highlights.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for the main text to give an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for the user interface to give a clean and objective presentation.
- Use simple, geometric icons for interactive elements, maintaining a clean and consistent style.
- A clean, structured layout with clear visual hierarchy. Content should be well-spaced and easy to navigate.
- Subtle transitions when changing the level of formality or displaying additional explanations.
